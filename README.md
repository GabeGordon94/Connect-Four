This project prompts the user to play the game Connect Four. 
First they will be greeted, and the two players will be prompted to give their names. Player One is in Red, and player two is in Yellow. Once the names are given, the game begins. The empty board appears with the columns numbered from 0-6.

 The user is asked which column they want to drop their respective color token. When they enter the column number the board reappears with the respective color letter at the bottom row. Immediately then it prompts the other player to input the column they want to enter the token into. This continues until the user enters four tokens in a row. The pattern can be either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. If the users fill up the board with no winning pattern, the game will state that there is a tie and the program will end. If the user wins the game will end, they will be congratulated for winning and the program will end.
